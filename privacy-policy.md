Privacy Policy for Your Daily Footnote
Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how Your Daily Footnote (“the App”) uses information.

1. Data the App accesses

The App reads public news content from external websites and RSS feeds.

The App posts generated content to a single Instagram Professional account controlled by the owner of this project.

2. Personal data

The App does not collect or store personal data about general users or visitors.

The only account data used is the Instagram and Facebook tokens and IDs required to publish posts to the owner’s Instagram account. These are stored securely as environment variables or secrets and are not shared with third parties.​

3. How data is used

Access tokens and IDs are used solely to authenticate with Meta’s APIs in order to publish automated posts.

Public news articles are processed to generate summaries and images; no private or non‑public user data is processed.​

4. Data sharing

The App does not sell or share any data with third parties.

Data may be processed by infrastructure providers used to run the App (for example, GitHub, GitHub Actions, or cloud hosting), only as needed to execute the code.​

5. Data retention and deletion

Access tokens and configuration data are kept only as long as needed for the App to function and can be revoked at any time by the owner.

If you interact with this project and want any information related to you removed, you can contact the owner and your data will be deleted where technically possible.​

6. Contact

For any questions or requests about this policy or data removal, please contact: sergej.dikun@gmail.com.

7. Changes to this policy

This policy may be updated from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page.
